# Learning Log

This is the running journal for the project. Each entry should explain what changed, what was learned, and what will be tested next.

## 2026-08-26 — Project foundation

### Context

The project is a personal exploration of reinforcement learning through a Geometry Dash agent.

### Decisions

- Start by validating the interaction loop before selecting an RL algorithm.
- Treat the repository as both the implementation and the learning record.
- Keep the local Geometry Dash installation outside version control.

### Initial hypothesis

The first technical risk is not the choice of algorithm. It is whether the agent can repeatedly observe the game, send an action, detect failure, and reset the level reliably.

### Next experiment

Build the smallest possible interaction prototype: capture one frame, send one jump or no-op action, and verify a reliable termination signal.

## 2026-08-26 — Capture/action prototype scaffold

### What changed

- Added `tools/capture_action.py`.
- Added Pillow as the first dependency for screen capture.
- Added an explicit `--action jump` flag; the default is a no-op.
- Kept game launching manual so the prototype cannot unexpectedly start the game.

### Current limitation

The first draft captured the primary display, which was too broad for an RL observation. The prototype now locates the visible window owned by `GeometryDash.exe`, focuses it, and captures only its client area. Game-state detection is still not implemented.

### Next test

Start Geometry Dash manually, run the prototype with `--action noop`, and inspect the two game-window frames. Only then test `--action jump`.
